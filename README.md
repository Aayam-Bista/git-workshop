# Pfafflab Git Guide

This repository is a helper to the git workshop performed in the lab. Check the wiki for the slides.

While the slides covers some conceptual aspects of git, they are merely there to understand what you need to do to be proficient with the tool. Some of the content here might not be 100% correct, but a way of understanding git that will make it easier to use. If you are curious and want to learn more there are thousands of git tutorials around, for a fast overview I recommend (this one)[https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/]. If you want to get a more detailed explanation the (git book)[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2] is an excellent resource.

In git there are usually many ways of doing the same thing, the best way of doing something might change depending on the situation. This is simply my way of doing almost everything you need to do.
